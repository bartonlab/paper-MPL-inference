# Contents

Scripts for generating and analyzing the simulation data can be found in the `simulation-analysis.ipynb` notebook, and references therein. Scripts for processing and analyzing the HIV-1 data are contained in the `HIV-analysis.ipynb` notebook. Finally, scripts for analysis and figures contained in the manuscript are located in the `figures.ipynb` notebook.  

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by simulations and by the interim analysis of HIV-1 data, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/3818038). Then download and extract the contents of the archives `src-MPL-HIV.tar.gz`, `src-wfsim-data.tar.gz`, and `src-Matlab-data.tar.gz` into the folders `src/MPL/HIV`, `src/wfsim/data`, and `src/Matlab`, respectively.

# MPL

This repository includes code for inferring selection coefficients from temporal genetic data using the marginal path likelihood (MPL) method. Code implementing MPL in C++ is located in the `src/MPL` directory.

### Software dependencies

MPL makes use of C++11 and the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). The code has been tested using GSL version 2.6. Compiling MPL should require a few seconds on a typical desktop computer.

### Demonstration

The shell script `src/MPL/run-test.sh` will compile and run MPL on an example set of simulation data (see Figure 1 in the manuscript). Estimated selection coefficients are stored in `src/MPL/test/example_0_T400_ns1000_dt1_MPL.dat`. This file should match the file of the same name in the `src/MPL/out` directory. Running this demonstration should require a few seconds on a typical desktop computer.
