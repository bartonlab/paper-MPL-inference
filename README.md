# Contents

Scripts for generating and analyzing the simulation data can be found in the `simulation-analysis.ipynb` notebook, and references therein. Scripts for processing and analyzing the HIV-1 data are contained in the `HIV-analysis.ipynb` notebook. Finally, scripts for analysis and figures contained in the manuscript are located in the `figures.ipynb` notebook.  

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by simulations and by the interim analysis of HIV-1 data, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/3332902). Then download and extract the contents of the archives `src-MPL-HIV.tar.gz` and `src-wfsim-data.tar.gz` into the folders `src/MPL/HIV` and `src/wfsim/data`, respectively.
